# R for Environmental Economics

This is a repository created for R for Environmental Economics. The material presented here is a short module that demonstrates the use of the versatile open-source software R in environmental economics courses. We look at several examples in environmental economics â€” forests, air pollution, and the spread of biologically invasive species like the coronavirus. 


# Learning objectives

The objective of the course material is to provide an introduction to students of environmental economics to using R. It is expected that the material will help students:

- learn basics of R and be able to navigate R studio
- learn basic data analysis using R
- learn basic data wrangling and graphing
- learn to use coarsened exact matching in R
- learn to simulate a simple SIR model in R

# Installing R and RStudio

1. Download R from https://cran.rstudio.com and install it on your system
2. Download RStudio Desktop from https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download and instal it on your system.

# Usage

The material can be used in a workshop or independently worked upon. There are five Rmd files numbered from 1 to 5. The material does not assume any previous knowledge of R and therefore starts with the basics in the first Rmd file. Either in labs or in flipped classrooms, students can work through the examples proceeding interactively line by line, learning from each other with some inputs from the instructor, and the source text and papers can be discussed alongside.
